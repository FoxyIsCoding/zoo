This site shows fun facts about sharks.. It also has a game where you can feed a shark fish! It has all that the event requires and more!


### Features:
 - fun facts about sharks
 - interactive game :3
 - responsive design

Its made using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.

The interactive section has a few hidden features..
You can pet the shark by clicking and dragging on it.. this will change the image to a cute petting shark! Next one is that you can ofc feed him to make him less hungry. 
If hunger is over 80%, his health will start to decrease over time!
Another one is that if you open it after 9pm your time, the shark will have a cute blanket on it and look sleepy :3
